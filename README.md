# CSE423-Project
In this project, we have tried to visualize the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun for given date using Computer Graphics. Here are the key ideas of this project.

1. X-axis => Along with the orbit line (aka the path) of the Earth.
2. Y-axis => Along with the axis of the Sun.
3. Z-axis => Perpendicular to the screen. (+) => outward of the screen.
4. Origin => The center of the Sun.
5. The size of the Earth increases when (x, y) of the center of the Earth are going towards (0, 0). (The Earth is getting closer to the viewer).
6. Similarly, The size of the Earth decreases when (x, y) of the center of the Earth are going away from (0, 0). (The Earth is moving away from the viewer).
7. For dates between Jul 1 to Dec 31 (z becomes (-)), the Sun overlaps the orbit line and depending on the date, also overlaps the Earth. (The Earth is going deeper into the screen).
8. The axis line of the Earth helps to locate the Earth when it goes behind the Sun.
9. The change is color of the Earth showcases the effect of the light emitting from the Sun. (The closer it gets to (x, y) = (0, 0) the darker it gets).

This project was completed as the final project of the course CSE423: Computer Graphics in Fall 2022.
